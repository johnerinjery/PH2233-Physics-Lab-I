# Determination of Refractive Index by Brewster Angle Method

**Brewster's angle** (also known as the polarization angle) is the angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is **perfectly transmitted** through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection. When unpolarized light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is perfectly polarized. — _Wikipedia_

## Overview

Experimental setup is as given in the manual. You calculate 3 sets of intensity for the same set of angles to smooth out errors as the detector reading fluctuates a lot. We calculate average intensity at an angle, along with uncertainty, and plot it.

## Theory

**Polarization, Polarizer, Analyzer:**<br>
Here's a great video by a Scottish guy with a very heavy accent explaining a polarizer and an analyzer. Highly recommended watch before the experiment.

## Notes

The calculations required in this experiment can be completely done on a software like Excel. I am including it mostly for completion. Do read the theory and experimental setup section — I clear some confusions I faced there.

Error is propagated as shown below:

$$
\delta n = sec^{2}(\bar{\theta})\times \delta \theta
$$
